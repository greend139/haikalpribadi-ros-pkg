     ROS bindings for Parallax Eddie robot.
     
     This is a generic driver for Parallax Eddie Robot 
     ( http://www.parallax.com/eddie ). The package publishes sensor data on 
     several topics, as well as providing services to call functions to the 
     serial board. The package also includes a controller to navigate the robot
     with linear/angular velocity. At the moment, this package is considered a 
     beta release. Development is still in progress.
